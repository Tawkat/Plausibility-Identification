## Identifying Plausibility of Implicit and Underspecified Fillers in Instructional Texts
Md Tawkat Islam Khondaker and Swati Kanwal

With the advent of new language models, different natural language processing-based downstream tasks have seen impressive improvement on their respective performances. However, understanding the plausibility of an instruction or the plausibility of a filler (a phrase) that completes the instruction has not been explored hitherto in the existing literature. To address this issue, we propose a range of strategies including pre-trained BERT-based models to learn the plausibility of instructional texts. We prove the efficacy of our strategies by tasking our models with the objectives of plausibility classification and plausibility ranking of the fillers on an instructional dataset. Through in-depth experimental studies and error analysis, we show the hardness of the problem and point out possible scope for improvements for the future research.


### Experimental Setting:
40GB NVidia A100 memory

*Due to the space constraints, we did not upload the pre-trained models on Github. If you are interested to use the pre-trained models, please email at tawkat@cs.ubc.ca.
